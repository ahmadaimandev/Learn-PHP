Form Handling
-> The PHP superglobals $_GET and $_POST are used to collect form-data.

GET vs POST
-> Both GET and POST create an array. e.g:
array(key1 => value1, key2 => value2...)
-> This array holds key/value pairs. where keys are the names of the form control
and values are the input data from the user.

-> Both treated as $_GET and $_POST. these superglobals, which means that they are always
accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without
having to do anything special.


-> $_GET is an array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters.
-> $_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via HTTP POST method.

When to use $_GET

- GET should NEVER be used for sending passwords or other sensitive information!

When to use $_POST
