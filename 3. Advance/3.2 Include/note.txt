PHP Include Files

-> include or require statement takes all the text/markup that exist in the specified files and copies it into the file
that are uses the include statement.
-> including files are very useful when you want to include the same PHP, HTML, or text multiples pages of website
-> It is possible to insert the content of one PHP  file (before the server executes it), with the include or require statement.


The include and require statement are identical, except upon failure.
* require = will produce fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script.
* include = will only produce warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue.
