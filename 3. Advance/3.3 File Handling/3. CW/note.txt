PHP File Create/Write

PHP Create File - fopen()
-> This function is also used to create a file.
*REMEMBER: in php, a file is created using the same function used to open files.
-> If you use fopen() on a file that does not exist, it will create it, given that the files is opened for writing (w) or appending (a)

example syntax:
$myfile = fopen("testfile.txt", "w")
