Lesson 3

-> Variables are "containers" for storing information.
-> use dollar sign ($) to declare a php variable.

example:

$Firstname = "Muhammad";
$Lastname = "Ali";


Rules for PHP variables:
- starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.
- variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- variable name cannot start with a number.
- variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
- Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables).

Remember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!

PHP data types: 
-> String
-> Integer
-> Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
-> Boolean
-> Array
-> Object
-> NULL
-> Resource

Get data type by using var_dump()


PHP variables scope

-> The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.

Three different variables scope:
-> local
-> global
-> static

Global and Local scope
A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function

GLOBAL keyword

The global keyword is used to access a global variable from within a function.
To do this, use the global keyword before the variables (inside the function)

example:
function myTest() {
  $GLOBALS['y'] = $GLOBALS['x'] + $GLOBALS['y'];
}


Static keyword
-> when a functions is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. 
however, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it a further job.
