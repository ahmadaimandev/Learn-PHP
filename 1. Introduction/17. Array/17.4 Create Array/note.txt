Lesson 17.4

-> There's 2 way to write an arrays
1. by using parentheses
-> You can create arrays by using the array() function:
$car = array("Proton");

2. By using brackets
-> You can also use a shorter syntax by using the [] brackets:
$car = ["Proton"];

-> Write multiline in array
-> Line breaks are not important, so an array declaration can span multiple lines:
$car = array[
    "Proton",
    "Perodua",
    "Toyota",
];

-> Trailing comma
-> A comma after the last item is allowed:
$car = array[
    "Proton",
    "Perodua",
    "Toyota",
];

-> Array Keys
-> When creating indexed arrays the keys are given automatically, 
starting at 0 and increased by 1 for each item
-> so the array above could also be created with keys

-> Declare an empty array
-> You can declare an empty array first, and add items to it later

-> Mixing array keys
-> You can have arrays with both indexed and named keys:
