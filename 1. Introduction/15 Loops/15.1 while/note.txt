Lesson 15.1 

While loop
-> while loops execute a block of codes as long as the specified 
condition is true.

NOTE: remember to increment $i, or else the loop will continue forever.

-> while loops does not run specific numbers of times, but check after iteration
of the condition is still true.
-> condition does not have to be counter, it could be the status of an operation or any condition
that evaluates to either true or false.
