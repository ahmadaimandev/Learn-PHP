Lesson 18

PHP superglobal

- Were introduced in PHP 4.1.0, and are built-in variables that are always available
in all scopes.

- Some predefined variables in php are 'superglobals' which mean that they are always 
accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access they from any functions,
class or file without having to do anything special.

PHP superglobal variables are:
- $GLOBALS
- $_SERVER
- $_REQUEST
- $_POST
- $_GET
- $_FILES
- $_ENV
- $_COOKIE
- $_SESSION
