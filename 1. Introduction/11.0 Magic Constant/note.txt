PHP - Magic Constant

- PHP Predefined Constants
* PHP has nine predefined constant that change value depending on where they used,
* And therefor they are called  "Magic Constant"
* These magic constants are written in:
1. Double underscore at the start and the end
2. Except for the ClassName::class constant

NOTE:
The magic constants are case-insensitive, meaning __LINE__ returns the same as __line__.
