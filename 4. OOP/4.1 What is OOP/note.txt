OOP
-> stands for object-oriented programming

Procedural and OOP
-> Procedural is about writing procedures and functions that perform operations on the data.
-> OOP is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

OOP advantages
1. Faster and easier to execute.
2. Provide clear structure for the programs.
3. Help the codes DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
4. Make it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

Classes and objects
-> This two things are two main aspects of OOP.

example:
Class Name: Fruits
Objects: Banana, Mango, Apple

-> Class is template for objects, and an object is an instance class.
-> When objects are created, they will inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class. but each object wil have different values of the properties.
