Classes And Objects
OOP Case
-> Assume we have class named fruit. 
-> Fruit properties can have like name, color, weight etc. We can define the variable that will hold the values for these properties    
-> When the individual objects (apple, banana, mango) are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, 
but each objects will have different values for the properties.

Define Objects
-> Classes are nothing without objects! we can create multiple objects from a class.
-> Each objects has all the properties and methods defined in the class, but they will have different properties value.
-> Objects and class are created using new keyword
