Lesson 6

-> string in php surrounded by single or double quotation marks.

Note: there's a big difference between single and double quotes:
1. double quotes process a special character, Meanwhile
2. single quote does not.

A. string length
-> strlen() = function returns length of string

B. Word Count
-> str_word_count() = function counts the number of words in a string

C. Search for text within a string
-> strpos() = function searches for a specific text within a string.
-> if match found, function returns character position of the first match
-> if not, it will return false.
