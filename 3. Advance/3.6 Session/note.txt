PHP Session

-> Session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.
-> Unlike cookie,the information is not stored on the users computer.

What is PHP Session
-> When you work on application, you open it,and then you close it. This much like a session.
-> The computers know who you are. It knows when you start the application and when you end it.

Problem
-> The web server does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.    
-> Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across multiple pages.
Eg: username, favorite color, etc
-> By default, session variables last until the user closes the browser.
-> So session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.

TIPS: if you need a permanent storage, you may want to store the data in database.

Start a PHP Session
-> Session is started with the session_start() function.
-> Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION
