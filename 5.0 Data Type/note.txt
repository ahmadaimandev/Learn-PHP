Lesson 5

Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.

- String
- Integer
- Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- NULL
- Resource

use var_dump() function to get data type of any Object

php object
-> Classes and Objects are two main aspects of OOP.
-> Class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

-> When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object
will have different value for the properties.

-> Let assumed we have a class named Car that can have properties like model, color etc. We can define Variables
like $model, $color, and so on, to hold the values of these propeties.

-> When the individual objects (volvo, BMW, Toyota, etc) are created, they inherit all the propeties and behaviorss
from the class, but each object will have different values of the properties.

-> if you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class.
