PHP Exceptions

-> What is an Exception?
* An exception is an object that describes an error or unexpected behaviour of a PHP script.
* Exception are thrown by maney functions and classes.
* Exceptions are good way to stop a functions when it comes across data that it cannot use.

-> Throwing an Exception
* Throw statement allowed a user defined function or method to throw an exception.
* When an exception is thrown, the following code it will not be executed.
* If an exception is not caught, the script will stop.

example:
<?php
function divide($dividend, $divisor)
{
    if ($divisor == 0) {
        throw new Exception("Division by zero");
    }
    return $dividend / $divisor;
}

echo divide(5, 0);
?>

output:
Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: Division by zero in C:\webfolder\test.php:4
Stack trace: #0 C:\webfolder\test.php(9):
divide(5, 0) #1 {main} thrown in C:\webfolder\test.php on line 4

-> The try...catch Statement
* To avoid the error from the example above, we can use the try...catch statement to catch exceptions and continue the process.

syntax:
try {
  code that can throw exceptions
} catch(Exception $e) {
  code that runs when an exception is caught
}
