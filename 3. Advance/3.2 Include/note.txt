PHP Include Files

-> include or require statement takes all the text/markup that exist in the specified files and copies it into the file
that are uses the include statement.
-> including files are very useful when you want to include the same PHP, HTML, or text multiples pages of website
-> It is possible to insert the content of one PHP  file (before the server executes it), with the include or require statement.


The include and require statement are identical, except upon failure.
* require = will produce fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script.
* include = will only produce warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue.


PHP include Vs. require

-> require statement is also used to include file into PHP code.

-> There's a big difference between include and require:
1. When a file is included with the include statement and PHP cannot find it, the script will continue to execute.
2. If we do same example using the require statement, the echo statement will not be executed because the script execution dies
after the require statment returned fatal error.
