PHP - Constant

-> Constant are like variables. except that once they change, they cannot be changed again.
-> Constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be change during the script.
-> A valid constant name start with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).
NOTE: Unlike variables, constant are automatically global across the entire script.

1. Create a PHP constant 
-> To create a constant, use the define() function:

Code syntax:
define(name, value, case-insensitive);

Parameter:
-> name: Specifies the name of the constant
-> value: Specifies the value of the constant
-> case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive
default is false. Note: Defining case-insensitive constants was deprecated in PHP 7.3. 
PHP 8.0 accepts only false, the value true will produce a warning.  


2. PHP const keyword
-> You can also create a constant by using the const keyword.


const vs define
* const are always case-sensitive
* define() has a case-insensitive option
* const cannot be created inside another block scope, like inside a function or inside an if statement.
* define can be created inside another block scope

3. PHP Constant Array
-> From PHP7, you can create an Array constant using the define() function.
