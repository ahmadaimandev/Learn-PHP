PHP Casting

* Sometimes you need to change a variable from one data type into another, 
* and sometimes you want a variable to have a specific data type. This can be done with casting.

-> Change Data Type
Casting in PHP is done with these statements:
* (string) - Converts to data type String
* (int) - Converts to data type Integer
* (float) - Converts to data type Float
* (bool) - Converts to data type Boolean
* (array) - Converts to data type Array
* (object) - Converts to data type Object
* (unset) - Converts to data type NULL
