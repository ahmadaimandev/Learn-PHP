Lesson 2.0 Form Validation

What is $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] variable
- is a super global variable that returns the filename of the currently executing script.
- sends the submitted form data to the page itself, instead of jumping to a different page. 
This way, the user will get error messages on the same page as the form.

What is htmlspecialchars() function
- function converts characters into html entities
- this mean it will replace HTML character like < and > with &alt; and &gt; 
- this prevent attackers from exploiting the code by injecting html or javascript code (crosssite scripting attacts)
